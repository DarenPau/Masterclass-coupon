* Discounted Cost: $10/month or $120/year (50% off)
The Premium plan becomes even more affordable with the discount, offering access for up to six people for the price of the original Standard plan.

No matter your age or profession, MasterClass offers opportunities to acquire valuable skills.

I have seen families where different members take a wide range of courses from cooking and gardening to leadership, communication, and business. Families wanting to use MasterClass should consider exploring their multi-user membership plans, as the individual plan is limited to one user and device.

Suppose, the Standard Plan drops from $120 per year to just $60 which gives you for a full year of high-quality learning then the discount also applies to the Plus and Premium plans, making it more affordable for pairs.

This offer ends on December 29th, 2024, and no coupon code is required so just, [sign up](https://bit.ly/3wGN7UM), and enjoy the savings.
